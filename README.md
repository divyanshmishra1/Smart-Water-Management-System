# 💧 Smart Water Management System using IoT

This project is an **IoT-based Smart Water Management System** designed to monitor and manage household or agricultural water usage efficiently. It uses a combination of sensors and microcontrollers to measure various water parameters like **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**, **water temperature**, and **flow rate**, while also tracking water levels using an **ultrasonic sensor**. The collected data is then sent to **ThingSpeak** for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## 🛠️ Working Principle

1. Arduino collects data from all sensors.
2. Sends the data via serial to the ESP8266.
3. ESP8266 connects to Wi-Fi and uploads data to ThingSpeak.
4. ThingSpeak stores and visualizes the data in real-time.
